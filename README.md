# Principles-of-Data-Science_forPython3

The original python script is for the python2.7, most of them can not be used for python3.
So when studying the book I am trying to make some new script based on python3..
nearly all code are key in but not copy in... this is also a self-study record..
if anyone think this helps, tell me and glad to know that..

Whatever the most effective method for learning something is to build it by yourself, rather than copying. 

All python script are named by something like PXX_XXX, P refer to pages of the book--note the Chinese version of the book!!
